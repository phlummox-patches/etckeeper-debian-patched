Patched version of `etckeeper`. Fixes
[this](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=884987)
bug, which bizarrely is 
[listed](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?src=etckeeper) on Debian's bugtracker
as "more information needed", despite the fact that the
bug, its cause, and a fix are all known.

A new .deb file can be rebuilt by running `make`.
