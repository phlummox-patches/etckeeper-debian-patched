I get this warning:

etckeeper warning: hardlinked files could cause problems with git:
PackageKit/events/post-transaction.d/README
PackageKit/events/pre-transaction.d/README

What kind of problems can happen?

In my use case it is no problem if the hardlink gets lost and two individual files
are in the repo.

 use etckeeper to track changes in /etc.

Up to now the output of git log looks like this:

I would like to see which files have changed.

Is there a way to get the list of changed files into the commit message of etckeeper?

In most cases only one to three files change.

If more than three files change, then it is enough to show the number of changed files.
